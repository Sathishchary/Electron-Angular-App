Chess Game: Basic Rules and Strategy
* In Chess
Two players alternate turns, moving one piece at a time, aiming to checkmate the opponent's king.
Each piece moves according to specific rules. The objective is to control the board and ultimately
capture the opponent's king.
* Basic Rules and Setup
- Board:
An 8x8 grid with alternating light and dark squares.
- Setup:
Each player has 16 pieces: 1 king, 1 queen, 2 rooks, 2 bishops, 2 knights, and 8 pawns.
- Placement:
Pieces are placed on the first two ranks from each player's view. The queen is placed on a square
matching her color.
- Starting:
White moves first. Players alternate turns.
* Piece Movement
- Pawn:
Moves one square forward (two on its first move), captures diagonally.
- Rook:
Moves horizontally or vertically any number of squares.
- Knight:
Moves in an "L" shape: two squares in one direction, then one square perpendicular.
- Bishop:
Moves diagonally any number of squares.
- Queen:
Moves like both rook and bishop - horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
- King:
Moves one square in any direction.
* Capturing
Pieces capture by landing on a square occupied by an opponent's piece. Pawns capture diagonally.
The king cannot be captured, only checked.
* Special Moves
- Castling:
A defensive move involving both the king and a rook. It improves safety and connects the rooks.
- Pawn Promotion:
When a pawn reaches the 8th rank, it can be promoted to any other piece (except king).
* Winning the Game
- Checkmate:
The king is in check and has no legal moves to escape.
- Resignation or Draw:
Players may resign or agree to a draw. Stalemate is also a draw.
* Key Strategies
- Control the Center:
Dominate the central squares (d4, d5, e4, e5) for maximum mobility.
- Develop Pieces Early:
Activate knights and bishops early for strong positions.
- Protect the King:
Castle early and avoid exposing your king or queen prematurely
